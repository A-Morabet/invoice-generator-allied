# Invoice Generator with Dynamic Calendar

Local hosted web app for invoice generation specially suited
for allied health professionals since it allows to dynamically
generate a calendar based on user input (the day the
rehabilitation sessions start and how many sessions the
patient will have per week); The calendar is then rendered
on a table alongside fees and total amount. It also has
an option to be toggled off and the invoice can be printed
without any buttons.

Made with HTML, Javascript and CSS only.
