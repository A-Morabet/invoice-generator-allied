# Invoice Generator with Dynamic Calendar

<img src="https://github.com/A-Morabet/invoice-generator-allied/blob/main/invoice.gif" width="256">

Web app for invoice generation specially suited
for allied health professionals since it allows to dynamically
generate a calendar based on the following user input:

- The day the rehabilitation sessions start.
- Number of sessions.
- Which days of the week the sessions will take place.
- Fee amount.
- Patient's first name.

It will then proceed to create a list of dates that respect the
conditions given by the user. The calendar is then rendered
on a table alongside the patient's name, fees and total amount.
Both calendar and table can be toggled off and the invoice can 
also be printed with hidden buttons through the "Print Invoice" button.

Made with HTML, Javascript and CSS only.
